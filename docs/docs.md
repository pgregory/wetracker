# Documentation

*Note:*{:style="color: red"} This documentation is currently under construction.

Welcome to the user manual for WeTracker. The documentation is organised into
sections, listed to the left in the main navitation menu. The manual serves as
both an introduction to the functionality of WeTracker and as a reference to
the same. It is structured to work equally well read beginning to end, or
piecemeal, as you wish to dig deeper into a particular aspect. 

This manual will teach you the operation of the WeTracker software, but is not
intended to teach music theory or practice.

Please feel free to <a href="mailto:aqsis1@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you
have any questions about this manual or the WeTracker application.
