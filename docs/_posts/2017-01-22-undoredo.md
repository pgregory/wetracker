With the latest update, I've enabled a full undo/redo system in WeTracker. This
has been possible largely due to the use of ImmutableJS for the global state. I
took a decision to use this to store global state after tinkering with React
and Redux as a framework for WeTracker at the start. While I decided not to use
these frameworks in the end, I learned a few lessons along the way that I liked
and adopted, this was one.

The main complication was the decision not to store the song itself in the
Immutable state. This took a while to remedy, but it's worth it. It basically
meant that the entire undo/redo system took less than a couple of hours to
implement. Having all data stored in an Immutable object means that any change
to the data results in a new version of the state, including all the song data
(this might sound highly inefficient, but thanks to some clever referencing in
the ImmutableJS implementation, it's actually fine). All changes to the song
are through a single function "set" on the state that merges in the given
changes and creates a new version of the data. Now, before that happens, the
current state is pushed onto a stack, and it's child's play from there to
traverse back and forward through history. 

As some operations can potentially result in multiple state changes, I added
some simple functions to the system to allow me to mark the start and end of an
atomic change, so for example, should adding a note to a pattern actually
result in first adding the relevant row, then the track and then the event, it
all looks like a single operation to the history, and can be undone/redone as
one. Apart from that, it all worked straigh away. 

The work to move the song into Immutable state has been big, and touched just
about every part of the code, including the brittle player, so it may have
introduced some regression, I'll be monitoring that, if anyone sees (or more
likely hears) any discrepancy in behaviour, please let me know.
