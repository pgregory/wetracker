From the very beginning, the WeTracker project has been dual purpose. Firstly to
create a web based FastTracker II style music tool, and secondly, to provide a
method to enable collaboration on music projects. All the work up to now has
been dedicated to the first part, but with recent additions, I've started
working on the very early stages of a second component to support the idea of
collaboration. 

To maintain separation of concerns, the back-end is an entirely separate service,
running currently on a separate Heroku dyno. All communication between the
front-end WeTracker app and the back-end is over a simple RESTful interface on
HTTP. 

Currently, the back-end is little more than a simple file server, but
underneath, it lays the foundations for much more. The back-end is a totally
separate NodeJS application, backed by MongoDB. It currently serves a simple
list of demo songs.  The songs are stored as compressed files in MongoDB's
GridFS filesystem, allowing it to store large files. The song files are backed
by simple JSON metadata, stored in the MongoDB as documents. It's possible to
query the backend for the list of demo songs using the following REST query:

`http://wetracker-be.herokuapp.com/songs`

which will return a JSON list of all songs stored in the back-end database.

The WeTracker application has been updated with the first changes to integrate
with this new service. The long empty "Browser" widget now lists these demo
songs, by querying the back-end service at startup. 

![Browser]({{site.baseurl}}/images/browser.png "Browser")

Double click on any of the demo songs to load it directly into the application. 

The back-end service will continue to develop alongside the front-end
application, ultimately it will provide a central location to store and share
your productions. It will grow to include collaboration services such as chat
and live shared editing of songs. Keep an eye here for future posts about this
exciting aspect of the project.

Onwards and upwards...
