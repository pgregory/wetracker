What is WeTracker?
------------------

**WeTracker** is a web based music composition application, bringing the world
of ditial audio into the browser. Create your music wherever you find the muse, just
login to the site from a Chrome or Firefox browser and start creating.

**WeTracker** has a heritage that can be traced back to the old school music
trackers of the '80's and '90's era, used prolifically in game music and the
"demoscene". Instruments are created by using samples of real instruments, or
taken from synthesizers, once loaded into the system, you can apply volume and
panning waveforms to control the playback of the sample. Music is created by
playing these instruments in "patterns". A pattern is a sequence of
instructions to do various things with the instruments, including playing
notes and applying various effects such as vibrato, volume/pitch slide,
arpeggios, etc. These patterns are then played in a sequence, repeating if
required to form the song.

**WeTracker** extends the capabilities of traditional trackers with built in
effect plugins for things like chorus, compression, filters etc. These can be
chained together and applied to each track to create amazing effects otherwise
difficult to achieve in a standard tracker.

Demo
----

Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself, it runs well in the latest
Chrome and Firefox, you can load songs in FastTracker 2 .xm format, or if
you're musically minded, start from scratch and load your own instrument
samples into the instrument editor in .wav or .mp3 format and start writing
your own music, and let me know how you get on.
