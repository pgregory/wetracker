Status
------

Currently very much work in progress, early in development. Feel free
to stop by the [github project](https://github.com/pgregory/wetracker) and 
give me some feedback, ideas and suggestions welcome. 
Contributions are also welcome, just clone and submit a pull request. I'm
always keen to get enhancement requests or bug reports, just add an issue to
the github project, follow the guidelines in the template when you create a new
issue to get the best chance of a response.

I'm very keen to hear from any tracker musicians who might be interested in
collaborating to make WeTracker a powerful online tracker solution, <a
href="mailto:aqsis1@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you're interested.

Demo
----

The current development status is being deployed to a test server on Heroku.
I'll update this periodically as new worthwhile functionality becomes
available.

[WeTracker Demo](https://wetracker.herokuapp.com/)

Try loading some songs from 
[Modland.com](http://modland.com/pub/modules/Fasttracker%202/) to test it out,
many work, some don't. If you find one that doesn't let me know and I'll add it
to the test list to be reviewed.

Read the [docs]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/intro) for usage details and guides.
