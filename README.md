WeTracker is a project to create an online, collaborative music creation suite.
The interface is designed to be flexible and configurable, using
[gridstack.js](https://github.com/troolee/gridstack.js) for layout, which
allows an infinite amount of configuration, place your widgets in any location you
like, instead of being constrained to the typical docker style interface. The
screenshot above shows the current, work-in-progress, 
[tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) style interface, this is
just one of the planned methods for editing music, others will follow, including
a more traditional horizontal style. The underlying music framework is able to 
support multiple visual representations.

The project will ultimately allow collaborative editing at varyious levels,
including live interactive editing by multiple users, and turn based non-realtime
music creation.

WeTracker is very early in development, I welcome ideas and suggestions, and of course
any contributions.

The current development status is deployed to Heroku for you to tinker with. You can't break anything, 
but at the same time, you can't save anything, so try it out and come back with suggestions and comments.
