WeTracker is a project to create an online, collaborative music creation suite.
The interface is designed to be flexible and configurable, using
[react-grid-layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout) for layout, which
allows an infinite amount of configuration, place your widgets in any location you
like, instead of being constrained to the typical docker style interface. The
screenshot above shows the current, work-in-progress, 
[tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) style interface, this is
just one of the planned methods for editing music, others will follow, including
a more traditional horizontal style. The underlying music framework is able to 
support multiple visual representations.

The project will ultimately allow collaborative editing at varyious levels,
including live interactive editing by multiple users, and turn based non-realtime
music creation.

This project is very early in its development, feel free to provide feedback and
ideas, or clone the project and contribute via pull requests.

WeTracker is built on React, using 
[react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate). To try it out 
for yourself, clone this repo and run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
